# Solar-Powered Cars — by Safial ☀️⚙️

This is my first visual engineering blog under the **Visual Engineering by Safial** series.

Here I break down how solar energy powers electric vehicles — from the photovoltaic effect to energy storage and motor drive systems.

## 🌞 What’s inside
- how solar panels convert sunlight into electricity (PV effect)
- how charge controllers and batteries store and regulate power
- how that power is used to drive motors efficiently
- challenges: efficiency, weather, weight, and cost

## ⚡ goal
to visualize every layer of a solar-powered car — from sunlight to motion — in a way that actually makes sense.
